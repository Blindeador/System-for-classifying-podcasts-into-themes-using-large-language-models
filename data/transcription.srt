1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I
2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Feel my way through the darkness
3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Got it by beating hard I
4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Ain't tell where the journey will end
5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I know where to start
6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
They tell me I'm too young to understand
7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's them caught up in a dream
8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, I will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So that's fine by me
10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So wake me up when it's all over
11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I'm wise I ran out of water
12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
All this time I was finding myself
13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Didn't know I was long
14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
So wake me up when it's all over
15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
When I'm wise I ran out of water
16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
All this time I was finding myself
17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And I didn't know I was long
18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
They don't like us
19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yeah, I know
20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Why?
21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, I know
22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yeah
23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I try to carry in the weight of the world
24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I only have two hands
25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
On my get the chance to travel the world
26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't have any plans
27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Wish that I could stay forever this young
28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Not afraid to close my eyes
29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Life's a game made for everyone
30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And love is a prize
31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So wake me up when it's all over
32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
When I'm wise I ran out of water
33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All this time I was finding myself
34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And I didn't know I was long
35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So wake me up when it's all over
36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
When I'm wise I ran out of water
37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
All this time I was finding myself
38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And I didn't know I was long
39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I didn't know I was long
40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I didn't know I was long
41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I didn't know I was long
42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I didn't know I was long
43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Get up, I killed things
44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Where are we going?
45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Somewhere with the lawn
46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So I ran out of water
47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All this time I was finding myself
48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And I didn't know I was long
49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I didn't know I was long
50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I didn't know I was long
51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But I only have two hands
52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So I ran out of water
